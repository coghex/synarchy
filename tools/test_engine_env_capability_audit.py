"""Unit tests for engine_env_capability_audit.py (issue #876 acceptance:
the audit detects an intentionally introduced capability-inventory gap
using synthetic fixtures, never by editing the real EngineEnv or the
real inventory doc).

Mirrors tools/test_persistence_inventory_audit.py's own approach: feed
the audit's pure functions synthetic Haskell record text and a
synthetic inventory doc, so these tests stay stable regardless of how
EngineEnv or the real inventory doc grow.

Usage:
  python3 tools/test_engine_env_capability_audit.py
Exit codes: 0 = all tests passed, 1 = one or more failed.
