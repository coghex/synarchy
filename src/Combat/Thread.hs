-- | Combat thread.
--
-- The thread drains the combat command queue (`combatQueue` on
-- `EngineEnv`) and dispatches each command to `Combat.Resolution`,
-- which runs full resolution (hit roll, body part, damage, wound,
-- death check) and pushes `CombatEvent`s onto `combatEventsRef`.
--
-- The thread also exists to give the combat sim an obvious home that
-- doesn't share contention with the unit thread (which is doing
-- per-tile movement at 30 Hz). Combat ticks at 60 Hz so attacks feel
-- snappy when commands arrive.
